Improvements:
Added a logo with the title. Used a function liner-gradient() for the background-image for both the index.html and about.html and set it to the right, with three different colours. Added a background image for the sidebar. Modified the chat box to make it look aesthetically pleasing. Changed the font colours to match and blend in with the background.
